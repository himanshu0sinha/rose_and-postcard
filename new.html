          <span>My Love,</span>
          <br />
          On this Rose Day, each petal symbolizes my admiration <br />for you.
          "Roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, and so are you! 
           Happy Rose Day, my dazzling darling! ðŸŒ¹ 
           Just like this rose, you make my heart bloom with joy and excitement.
           Here's to a day filled with cheesy smiles, stolen glances, and 
           lots of love. Can't wait to hold you close and shower you with kisses.
           You're the cheese to my macaroni! ðŸ˜‰ðŸ’–"
